##Japanese Characters and Intertwined Spirals
Part 1: Japanese Character Recognition
For Part 1 of the assignment you will be implementing networks to recognize handwritten Hiragana symbols. The dataset to be
used is Kuzushiji-MNIST or KMNIST for short. The paper describing the dataset is available here. It is worth reading, but in short:
significant changes occurred to the language when Japan reformed their education system in 1868, and the majority of Japanese
today cannot read texts published over 150 years ago. This paper presents a dataset of handwritten, labeled examples of this oldstyle script (Kuzushiji). Along with this dataset, however, they also provide a much simpler one, containing 10 Hiragana characters
with 7000 samples per class. This is the dataset we will be using.
